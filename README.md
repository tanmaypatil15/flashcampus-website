# FlashCampus â€“ Static UI Website
FlashCampus is a simple static website project developed in 2019 as a practice exercise during my education. It was created to experiment with basic HTML and CSS for designing user interfaces. Though it lacks functionality, this project serves as a nostalgic reminder of my early steps in web development.
